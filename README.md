# youtubetospotify
 My first project: Create a playlist on Spotify containing all songs from your liked YouTube videos

 I was inspired by Bukola, a creator on YouTube, who made a Tutorial for this type of project in Python. I really liked it and decided to do something similar. Since I'm learning how to code in Java, I thought it would be a cool idea to model my first project after hers, but written in Java of course.

 I used the Spotify Web API and YouTube Data API as well as the yt-dlp.
